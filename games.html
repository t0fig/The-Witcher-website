                    <p>In 1996 and 1997, a Witcher video game was being developed by Metropolis Software in Poland,
                        but it was canceled. The game's director was Adrian Chmielarz, former People Can Fly co-owner
                        and creative director, who coined the translation "The Witcher" during its development.
                        According to Chmielarz, the game would have been a 3D action-adventure game with role-
                        playing elements such as moral choices and experience points.</p>
                    <p>In 2003, Polish video-game developer CD Projekt Red negotiated with Sapkowski for rights
                        to The Witcher, given the languishing work at Metropolis, and released The Witcher, a role-
                        playing game based on the saga in October 2007 for personal computers. It was well-publicized
                        and, although it was the developer's first game, it received critical praise in Europe and North
                        America. The Witcher was published
                        in Poland by CD Projekt and worldwide by Atari. A console version, The Witcher: Rise of the
                        White
                        Wolf with the same story and
                        a different engine and combat system, was scheduled for release in fall 2009 but was canceled
                        that
                        spring.</p>
